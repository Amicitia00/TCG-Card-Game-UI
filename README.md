# Director's Note
Developers ultimately need to learn how to collaborate. I wanted to conduct a project of an appropriate size where we could all learn together why we need to consider the domain perspective when developing software, the importance of communication, the importance of documentation, and the importance of issuing issues. We decided that this would be the most appropriate way to secure meaningful project results while carrying out all of the above in a short period of time.  

A chronic problem in the embedded and hardware fields is collaboration. SW developers who cannot collaborate, no matter how much experience they have, reduce productivity in creating something together. The purpose is to gain experience in collaborative and large-scale software development.  

And finally we did it. We have confirmed that not only web/app development but also game development can achieve high productivity at low cost using agile methods.
