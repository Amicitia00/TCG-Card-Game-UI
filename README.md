# Director's Note
Developers ultimately need to learn how to collaborate. I wanted to conduct a project of an appropriate size where we could all learn together why we need to consider the domain perspective when developing software, the importance of communication, the importance of documentation, and the importance of issuing issues. We decided that this would be the most appropriate way to secure meaningful project results while carrying out all of the above in a short period of time.  

A chronic problem in the embedded and hardware fields is collaboration. SW developers who cannot collaborate, no matter how much experience they have, reduce productivity in creating something together. The purpose is to gain experience in collaborative and large-scale software development.  

And finally we did it. We have confirmed that not only web/app development but also game development can achieve high productivity at low cost using agile methods.

# Review
Unlike Server, there are some shortcomings in Domain expression when it comes to expressing the UI on the screen. Because the mission had to be completed within a short period of time and the domain expression was not familiar, there were quite a few difficulties in the frame expression. Next time I make one, I want to separate the Mouse Left Click Event, Mouse Right Click Event, Mouse Drag Event, and Mouse Release Event Domains. Additionally, a large amount of infra/repository was used to express each state. This is also tied to battle_field, so in the next work, it is necessary to improve productivity by coordinating each Element and the tasks related to it and better separating each Domain Element.
